A small, lightweight UWP music player.

## Brief Introduction

Aurora Music has been one of four finalists in **Design Innovator** of [Windows Developer Awards 2018](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/projects/events/build/2018/awards?utm_campaign=devawards18&utm_source=devcenter&utm_medium=owned&utm_content=hero)! ðŸŽ‰

Aurora Music is built for a modern, fluent experience of listening music on Windows 10. It is MIT Licensed, you can fork it and build your own personalized music players.

Meanwhile, Aurora Music is extensible, we've preserved interface for lyrics, metadata and online musics. Building your extension can extend the ability of Aurora Music. We're also planning to support more advanced extensibility, such as audio effects, UI layouts, etc. Please see [To-Dos](https://github.com/pkzxs/Aurora.Music/blob/master/README.md#to-dos).
